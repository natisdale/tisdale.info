        <p>Design is fun, but it's even more exciting to transform that design into a reality with a site or app that stops being a thought experiment and becomes a product available to the public, like the two apps below.</p>

            <h2>Culminating Exhibition Portal</h2>
            <p>My capstone project for the Bachelor of Science in Computer Information Sytems at California State University, Chico was inspired by my undergaduate work in Art and a desire to solve a problem for their College of Arts. 
              There was a lack of archival of the culminating exhibition projects in the College of Arts. I designed and built a web application that allowed students to upload their culminating exhibition project details and images and view them in a gallery format.
              This allowed long term archive, search, and invitations to upcoming exhibitions.</p>
            <p>The application was built with Python, Django, PostgreSQL, blob storage all running on Microsoft Azure.</p>

            <h2>Sticker Pack for iOS</h2>
            <p>My first work published to the App Store was a Sticker Pack for the Messages app.
              This helped me get familiar with Xcode and Apple's submission process.</p>
            <p>The artwork was produced with Adobe Illustrator, and the Sticker Pack was built with Xcode.</p>
