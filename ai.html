        <h1>Observations on AI</h1>
        <p>I explored AI in 2025 as a student, designer, and engineer.
          Over the year I came to understand some of the capabilities and limitations of tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Soros, ElevenLabs, Cursor, and more.
          There's no doubt that AI can help developers, creatives, and many other workers.</p>
        <p>Leadership teams would be smart to consider how AI can empower their staff, but should realize replacement isn't a realistic option.
          AI is based around guessing algorithms.
          That's actually not far off from how most of us intuit through our day, but the human experience provides invaluable context.
          The human context, empowered by AI, can be a powerful combination.</p>
        <p>I hope these anecdotes provide inspiration to explore, and find where true value is in the context of your own pursuits. 
          Always remember, the GIGO (garbage in, garbage out) principle applies; 
          designers, with a strong understanding of design systems and human interaction, can provide the context and judgment needed to effectively leverage AI.</p>

            <h2>Video Creation</h2>
            <p>There is no shortage of video slop these days. When a project came up to produce longer video, I decided to explore what it takes to make a high quality video with AI.</p>
            <p>I planned out my design, and used AI to generate images for a storyboard, create videos for each scene, create voice overs for each scene, and to synchronize lip movement with the audio.  
              I assembled scenes and title screens into the final video using iMovie.</p>

            <h2>App Development</h2>
            <p>I wanted to better understand what it actually means to build with AI, beyond demos and hype.
              Rather than start something new, I pulled a small project off my back burner and used it as a test case.</p>
            <p>My goals were to explore:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Where AI can genuinely assist in the design process</li>
              <li>Where AI introduces friction</li>
              <li>Where human creativity and judgment remain essential</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I used Cursor to help build a React Native app, iterating through prompts, refactors, and corrections along the way.
              Additionally I used ChatGPT to help with most of the translation</p>
            <p>AI accelerated some parts far more than others—and a few places slowed me down.
              If you're experimenting with AI-assisted development, I'd love to compare notes.</p>

          <h2>Generative AI Ethics</h2>
          <p>Generative AI is a powerful tool, but it raises important ethical considerations, both in training and in use.
            As AI-generated content becomes more prevalent, issues such as misinformation, bias, and intellectual property rights come to the forefront.
            It's crucial for creators and users alike to approach AI with a sense of responsibility and awareness of its potential impacts on society.</p>
            <p>Here is a Brand Red Team report I created, while taking AI for Artists and Entrepreneurs at <a href="https://www.mcad.edu">MCAD</a>, that illustrates how Keanu Reeves' brand might be misused in AI-generated content.</p>
